* An interface to the "pastery.net" API in Emacs (kata/exercise)

A (to be) quick and dirty elisp interfacing with the [[https://www.pastery.net/][pastery API]]

I do not own the Pastery web service and neither I'm affiliated with it.

I am not aiming at providing a professional tool of sorts: this is just meant as an exercise to interface with external API with Emacs and test/mock web-services.

Full Documentation/description TBD.
